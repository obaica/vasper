! ! First, enter the energetic window in eV (relative to the Fermi level):
! COHPstartEnergy -10
! COHPendEnergy 5
! !
! ! Then, specify which types of valence orbitals to use:
! includeorbitals s p d
! ! You can also specify the basis functions per element manually, e.g.:
! ! basisfunctions Ga 4s 4p
! ! basisfunctions Sr 5s 4s 4p ! Sr_sv potential
! !
! ! Now define the pairs for which COHP analysis etc. should be done.
! The atoms are numbered as per order in the PAW-code control file.
! cohpbetween atom 1 atom 10
! !
! ! If you are interested in single orbital COHPs, you can get all the pairs
! ! like s-s, s-p_x, ..., p_z-p_z. Uncomment this line to switch it on:
! ! cohpbetween atom 1 atom 2 orbitalwise
! !
! ! If you want to generate the COHP pairs automatically, use this to include
! ! all pairs in a given distance range (in Angstrom, not in atomic units):
! ! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5
! ! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5 type Ga type Sr
! ! and in the latter case only between the specified elements
